### Morality in the Gospel
#### I. Healing from Sin
1. Jesus' name and mission -- Savior
    1. From what?
        1. If what you think you need to be saved form is a worldly evil, you
           will reject Christ
2. Miracles

    > The two dismissals of Christ miracle narratives (cosmology):
    > 1. It would be incompatible for God to break his own Law
    > 2. "That was a prescientific age"
    > "Joseph doesn't immediately submit to Mary conceiving by the Holy Spirit
    because he knows enough about human nature to know better"

    1. show that Christ has the power to put an end to all manner of earthly
       evils
       1. This shows that Jesus is not here to solve worldly problems
       2. Thousands of sick people following him and he goes off to pray alone

    > Fundamentally we are here to be healed from sin, not reform the liturgy

    2. His power over worldly evils show she has power to save from *sin*.
        1. mercy = spiritual healing from sin
3. Sin goes deeper than you might think -- [[ Matt 6 |sermon on the mount]]
4. [[Matt 6]] -- fighting sin w/ [[threefold-concupiscence]]
    1. Concupiscence of flesh -- Almsgiving
        1. Make a donation of money
           Truth
        2. Make your gift pure -- you don't get a kickback
        > you don't get your name on a brick or a pew
        3. Leads to financial peace

    2. Concupiscence of the eyes -- fasting
        1. Make a donation of a physical comfort
        2. Make your gift pure -- you don't splurge on seafood on Friday
        3. Historically, xxx 
        > Having a problem thinking about sex? Stop eating for a while.

    3. Concupiscence of pride -- prayer
        1. Make a donation of time
        2. Make your gift pure -- don't multitask/set time aside
        3. Maximizes peace and the fruitfulness of what God wants to use you for

    > This is at the HEART of our Lord's moral teaching


> The gifts of the magi represent prayer, fasting, and almsgiving

> Unless Jesus is the one that is offended by sin, he cannot be the one to
forgive sin (CCC)

> The Three resurrection miracles in the Gospels demonstrate levels of sin:
> 1. Little girl -- OMG its not me im sorry
> 2. Widow's son -- Terminal sin
> 3. Lazarus -- If you knew Lazarus in his state of decay, you wouldn't know
>    what he looked like alive -- mortal sin

[[ Luke 18#9]]ff: even if you're doing all these things, you'll still nee to ask
for more mercy

> Pride and sin are public enemy number one

#### II. Conforming to the standard of Divine Love
1. [[ John 13]] -- love one another as I have loved you
    1. [[ Matt 22]] -- greatest commandment: Love the Lord with you all your
       mid, heart, and soul, and love your neighbor as yourself
2. [[ Phil 2]] -- *Kenosis*: self-emptying
    1. Unlimited self-gift/Self-sacrifice
3. Giving and forgiving without parameters
    > In Christ, the new minimum for everyone is giving *everything* 

    > OT expectation of exponential vengeance
    > NT expectation of exponential forgiveness

    > Kreef -- every our Father, you're praying that God sends you to hell if you
    > don't forgive.
4. Have to resist any system that values selfishness 
5. [[ Beatitudes ]] as descriptions of those who have been self-emptied, and are now
   free to love with the love of Christ ^60ca8b
    1. [[Matt 5#3|Poor in spirit]] -- empty of material needs
    2. [[Matt 5#4|Those who mourn]] -- empty of comfort
    3. [[Matt 5#5|Meek]] -- empty of control/anger
    4. [[Matt 5#9|Peacemakers]] -- empty of tribalism/us v.s them
    5. [[Matt 5#6|Hunger and thirst for righteousness]] -- empty of self-satisfaction
    6. [[Matt 5#7|Merciful]] -- empty of vindictiveness 
    7. [[Matt 5#9|Pure of heart]] -- empty of the pleasures that make  it impossible to see
      divine things clearly
    8. [[Matt 5#10|Persecuted and reviled]] -- empty of vanity
