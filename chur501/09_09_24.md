#### Montenus, priscilla, and maximilla
1. Montenists were pretty popular (but heretical)
2. Tertullian spoke aprovingly of them, but seems opposed to some of its views. He liked its zeal and ascetical rigor, as he was concerned with a rising complacency.  He drew distinctions, downplaying priscilla and maximilla and their new "prophesies" and extolling their scriptural interpretations and zeal for martyrdom.
