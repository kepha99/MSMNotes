### Judaism in the time of Jesus
 - Tensions in Jewland because of Roman Rule
 - The idea of a Messiah is very popular - notably as a political idea
  - Jesus chastises people for this misunderstanding
 - Rome is strongly anti-king
  - in localities they are looking for local ruler to control the territory for them
  - Herod lobbied the Roman senate to become Jewking
 - Roman conquest of Palestine culminating in the capture of Jerusalem
  - they take it from the Hasmodeans - successors of the Macchabees (how do you spell this?)
 - The Romans recognized the Sanhedrin as having competency in legal matters for the Jews.

### Palestinian "Jewry" (I don't think that means what you think it means.)
 #### Four Elements
  1. Monotheism: 
  2. Covenant: God has an exclusive relationship with the Jews
  3. Messiah: there are consequences of this relationship that have to do with freedom, autonomy, material success.
  4. Law: Code of law that governs behaviors, relationships, etc.
    - Romans love law
 #### Pharisees vs Sadducees:
  - Pharisees:
   - the "seperated ones"
   - the law is how we tell us from them
   - interpreting the law and legislating conduct derived from the law
   - suspicious of the sanhedrin and collaboration with the Romans
   - synagogues
  - Sadducees:
   - Temple worship - the law is about temple cult
   - We do sacrifice to the true God - that is what sets us apart
   - Focus on Torah as description of temple cult
   - Rich -> not majority party, but a lot of influence
   - Rationalists, no belief in angels, afterlife, resurrection
   - Opportunistic in dealing with the Romans

 #### Other parties:
  - Hasideans
   - The law is an expression of God's ultimate will
   - What matters is not the letter, but the spirit (if you will)
  - Essenes
   - we know about them because of excavations at Qumran and Dead sea scrolls
   - they were semi-monastic seperated from the rest of the Jews.  Jewmonks
   - They believed in fidelity to the law - priveledging purity such that they were driven from public life
   - Proto-amish - historians such as Josephus think they're weirdos
   - They didn't like:
    - Laxity with marriage laws
    - Becoming rich by Roman cooperation
    - Pollution of Jerusalem
  - Zealots
   - (mostly) peaceful protestors
   - very hawkish in their conception of observance of the law
   - very strict interpretation
   - regarded by the Romans as a threat - assassins and agitators
   - They kill people
 
 #### Jewish Diaspora
  - Influential in the spread of Christianity
  - Far more Jews outside Jerusalem than inside.
  - There are huge affluent Jewish communities in population centers around the Mediterranian
  - Primarily they spoke Greek.  Greek was even the language of their Synagogue worship.
  - Alexandria was one of the most influential and had some famous figures
   - Philo
    - who took stoic and neo-platonic phil. and tried to use it to interpret OT
    - who put the Old Testament in contact with Greco-Roman Liturature

### Jesus of Nazareth and the Church
 - Three main sources:
  1. Synoptic Gospels
  2. Johannine Corpus
  3. Pauline Letters
 - The sources display concern for cultivating a new community
  - A Church, if you will
  - Duties in the Church:
   - Teaching (think Paul)
   - Judgement (Rendering decisions on moral questions)
   - Priest (Priestly ministry)
   - Mission (spreading the Gospel, bringing in new members)
 - Early church history is hard to see
  - not a lot of great historical documents
  - Letters are generally pastoral -> specifically addressing problems
   - you can only glean so much by looking at their problems
  - Letters indicate a need for firmness in faith and building institutions
   - The replacement for Judas
   - Deacons
   - Meetings
   - Evangelization outside of Roman Palestine and people of other cultures
 - There was persecution and development of sharper distinctions
  - Between Christians and Jews
  - Between Romans and Jews
  - The Romans by end of 1st. c. AD. were pretty fed up wi/ the Jews
 - Early Church:
  - Hierarchy
  - Jesus is Messiah
  - Liturgical Activity
   - Mass, Annointing, Fasting, etc.

What does development mean - we aren't reading back into history, but we do see its impact on us.
