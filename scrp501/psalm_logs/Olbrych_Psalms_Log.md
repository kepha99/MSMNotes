1. Sunday Matins. First psalm in the psalter - The first three psalms of the psalter will be the first three psalms of the Pius X psalter. - The happiness of the just man contrasted with the punishments on the wicked.  This is a theme that will be repeated again and again throughout the psalter.  The just man is like a fruitful tree, the unjust like dust driven from the earth by wind.
2. Sunday Matins. Second psalm, also introductory - First mention of opposition between the King on Sion, the Lord's son, and the Gentiles / the people of the earth.  General layout: The vain but futile pride of the nations, a benediction of the Lord's anointed, a warning to those who rule of God's anger against undisciplined rulers

1-2 Reflection:  How would I write a preface for a mighty book of songs? It would seem out of place to begin with some prosaic epithets about the author, especially if he were of high regard.  David needs no introduction - these psalms introduce theme, not author.  The Law of the Lord brings life.  The wicked will perish.  The king is the Lord's son.  The world strives against the Almighty and His anointed one.  Live justly and fear the Lord!  These relatively terse verses sum up and prepare us to read all that is to come. 

3. Sunday Matins. Psalm of David - in flight from his third son, Absalom.  A petition to the Lord.  The psalmist notes his troubles - many enemies, and he is counted as without hope.  The psalmist then notes his trust in God - he sleeps soundly, he has no fear despite thousands of foes. Concludes noting God's just rewards to David's adversaries, and God's blessing on His people.
4. Sunday compline. Psalm of David: Verse 2: First instance of the psalmist asking for mercy. An ardent petition to those who follow false loves -> God hears and has good things in store for those who are just.  Do justice and God will bless you.
5. Monday Lauds 1&2. Psalm of David: first five verses are a continuous cry to God to listen for God is not a god "volens iniquitatem."  As such, God will not suffer the wicked to prosper.  The psalmist in God's mercy will worship Him.  Then follows a contrast of the wicked with those (us) who hope in the Lord.
6. Monday Compline. The three preceding psalms have the incipit "in finem."  This is the darkest of the three.  Saint Thomas notes that "in finem" might be understood as referring to Christ, the true End of the law, or perhaps that it was composed and sung at the completion of some matter.  In any case, apart from the last three verses, the whole psalm is about the tears and sufferings of David and an extended petition for God to save David from the depths of misery and oppression.
7. Monday compline. This psalm has three sections: first, a petition for salvation from the persecutors, second, the insistence of the psalmist on his own purity/guiltlessness (with a very bold request: "judica me, Domine, secundum _justitiam meam_"), third, the retribution the Lord will exact on the evildoers.
8. Sunday Matins, following 1-3. A psalm of awe, wonder, praise: Awe at God, awe at His Name, awe at creation, awe at God's predilection for poor mortal man.  Begins and ends with an antiphon: "Domine, Dominus noster, quam admirabile est nomen tuum in universa terra!"  Psalms 8-13 will bring back the incipit: "In finem ... Psalmus David"
9. Sunday Matins - the psalter breaks it in four. Begins with a hymn of thanks followed by what seems like a savoring of what God will visit upon the opposing nations(6-13). 14 breaks this theme - begging for mercy upon the psalmist.  15-end is a familiar cycle: blessings of the just, petition for God's help, pride and sufferings of the wicked contrasted by God's tenderness toward the lowly.  A psalm that acts generally as an exhortation to humility as it ends with the verse:  "Desiderium pauperum exaudivit dominus... judicare pupillo et humili, ut non apponat ultra magnificare se homo super terram."
10. Sunday Matins.  A funny verse, "quomodo dicitis animae meae: transmigra in montem sicut passer?"  Augustine treats this as though the enemy were exhorting the psalmist to place his trust in the mountains of the proud or to seek refuge among heretics, while David knows that he already is safe upon the mountain of God.  The Lord is described in the next verses as a just and searching Judge, who examines men and gives to each his portion.  Short and sweet.
11. Tuesday Compline. Save me, Lord, for the saint fails, for truths have been shattered by the sons of men.  A strong opening - The opening seems to imply this is a song in time of calumny.  The main theme will be truth and the deceit of the proud.  The Lord's words are like silver tried by fire - they are totally pure and tested - purgatum septulum - refined seven times.
12. Tuesday Compline.  A short song in time of trial -> usquequo shall my enemies triumph, quamdiu I suffer.  The end is of hope and trust -> I have trusted, I will exult and sing to the name of the most high.
13. Monday Matins.  The world has gone to hell.  The source of part of Anselm's famous meditation on the fool, who says "non est Deus." The poor state of the godless who afflict God's people.  The end notes the final triumph that Israel and Jacob shall have in the end.
14. Monday Matins.  A description of the qualities of the kind of man who shall rest in the Lord and stand firm forever. He does no evil or scandal to his neighbor, swears truthfully without deceit, is no usurer, takes no bribes, and glorifies the Godly.
15. Tuesday Compline.  The psalmist trusts in the Lord.  The Lord is his true sustenance and reward, and David will not turn to the false idols.  The prayer during the purification of the paten includes part of this psalm.
16. Monday Matins. Verse 8 at compline each night. "Custodi nos, Domine, ut pupillam oculi; sub umbra alarum tuarum protege nos."  The psalm has generally three familiar themes in succession: The psalmist's innocence, petition for protection from malice and the enemy, petition for/envisioning of just rewards for the same.
17. Monday Matins, divided in three parts.  David's prayer to the Lord on the day that the Lord delivered him from Saul etc. This is a very long psalm that is totally triumphant (as the circumstances would merit). Reminds me a lot of psalm 117 (Sunday prime).  Like, _A LOT._ If you put in the two verses about bees (circumdederunt me sicut apes...) and chastisement(castigans castigavit me...) I don't think I could distinguish them on first glance. Lots of talk of being delivered and the enemies perishing and being crushed and humiliated, etc.  Thanks be to God.  The incipit: "In finem" returns again through psalm 21
18. Monday Prime, divided into two.  This is where we get the versicle for the common of apostles: "in omnem terram exivit sonus eorum, etc."  God is compared to the sun and to a bridegroom.  There are a number of things which are distinguished: Lex, testimonium, justitiae, timor, judicia.  This is reminiscent of upcoming psalm 118, the big acrostic one about the law.  This is kind of an abbreviated version.  Is there a parallel between psalms 17-18 and 117-118?
19. Monday Matins.  A beautiful blessing upon someone (upon David?).  an instance of a common phrase/theme: "God is to be trusted in more than chariots, etc."
20. Monday Matins.  A prayer of thanksgiving for the victories and joys and riches of the king, followed by a very spicy imprecatory prayer against the enemies for being wicked and plotting against the Lord's goodness.
21. Friday Prime, divided in three.  One of the darkest psalms -> A prophetic psalm of the sufferings of Christ. v. 1-22 are filled with suffering, darkness, and feeling of being abandoned.  v. 23-end speak of being heard by God and the final triumph and glory.  The poor shall have their fill, I shall praise You in the midst of a church, etc.  An excess of dry and empty despair followed by what seems an equally immoderate praise.
22. Thursday Prime. Notably the Vulgate begins "Dominus __regit__ me, et nihil mihi deerit"  This emphasizes the connection between being _ruled_ by God and prospering.  The nova vulgata, that scholarly nightmare, changes this to pascit to fit the shepherd analogy explicitly.  As if Jerome was wrong and hadn't thought to use a more shepherdly word.  For shame, you translators by committee! After this cool opening follows the good shepherd allegory in all its peace and beauty. 
23. Monday Prime.  This song sounds explicitly liturgical - quis ascendet in montem Domini, aut quis stabit in loco sancto ejus?  Innocens manibus et mundo corde, etc.  These qualities are remeniscent of psalm 14.  second half of psalm seems like it could be some sort of antiphonary call and response - a hymn of praise to the King of Glory.  I could imagine praying this before Sunday Mass someday.
24. Tuesday Prime, divided in three. A song of petition after falling into some sin.  First explicit mention of the sin of the psalmist in the psalter.  Remember your mercies; forget the sins of my youth!  This is a psalm that notes the humility of the psalmist in his sin, and begs the Lord for gentleness, mercy, and a way forward.

3-24 Reflection:  These psalms are arranged in the psalter in general order over the first couple days (you have to squint a little) but not at vespers.  They seem suitable for the first few hours of prayer througout the day -> to begin the day with these cries for the Lord's assistance, and to carry these out throughout the day's work before its accomplishment is natural.  The more triumphant thankful psalms will fall toward the end of the day, culminating in prayers at night having some theme related to death and/or rest.  This is consistant with the aim of the Office as a sanctification of the day, and each day being a kind of minature allegory for life - birth in the morning, trial througout the day, a kind of death in the evening, culminating in a rebirth the next day.

25. Wednesday Prime.  We return to the theme of the psalmist insisting on his innocence, and asking God to judge and test him.  The psalm prayed at the Lavabo from verse 6-end.
26. Monday Terce, divided in two.  I primarily associate this psalm with its adaptation as an Introit (4th Sunday after Pentecost).  Dominus illuminatio mea et salus (vita) mea, quem timebo? etc.  It's one of the few antiphons constantly stuck in my head.  Speaks of trust in the Lord despite all else failing, and despite the tribulations of the enemies.  Reminiscent of Kirkegard's notion of sublimity -> The psalmist is secure in the midst of great trials, for he trusts in the Lord.
27. Monday Terce. A plea for the Lord not to remove his presence, followed by a prayer for the Lord to come and render justice to the wicked.  Then the psalmist notes that the Lord _has_ heard his cry, and that the Lord is the strength of His people.  The psalm concludes with words used in the verse-response section at the end of the Te Deum.  Salvum fac populum tuum, Domine, et benedic hereditati tuae.
28. Monday Lauds.  A majestic hymn of the immense power of the Lord's voice.  Aquinas notes that it was written on the occasion of the Ark of the Covenant being returned to the completed tabernacle in Jerusalem Jerusalem in 2 Samuel 6.  The English NO breviary alliterates verse 7 in a funny way that's fun to say: The Lord's voice flashes flames of fire -> it's also fun to say intercidentis flammam ignis.
29. Monday Matins.  Dedication song for David's house.   This psalm is of thanksgiving after having been saved/forgiven by the Lord. A good penitential psalm to pray after confession.  Notable phrase introduction verse 7: "Ego autem dixi in abundantia mea" seems like it is repeated in psalm 30, and psalm 115 with some variations. 30:23 "Ego autem dixi in excessu mentis meae" and 115:2 "Ego dixi in excessu mea"  Aquinas notes that here the psalmist, in time of abundance/riches he became presumptuous and spoke pridefully -> and pride preceeds sin.  In the very next verse: "avertisti faciem tuam a me, et factus sum conturbatus."
30. Monday Sext.  The beginning psalm seems to be the source for another common verse and response (see last prayer at end of Te Deum): "In Te, Domine, speravi; non confundar in aeternum."  Also, source for verse/response at compline every night, and Our Lord's words from the cross: "In manus tuas commendo spiritum meum; redemisti nos, Domine Deus veritatis."  This psalm of asking God to look upon his suffering servant was certainly present on Our Lord's mind during the Passion.
31. Monday None. Another psalm with penitential theme - Blessed are those whose sins have been remitted!  This psalm notes the joy of those who have been forgiven, the pain of sin, that honesty before God is necessary for forgiveness.  I think of this line when approaching the confessional: Dixi, confitebor adversum me injustitiam meam Domino, et tu remisisti impietatum peccati mei.  Don't be like the stupid horses and mules >:(
32. Monday None, divided in two. Another song of praise of God as transcendant over the nations and all created powers, and an exhortation to praise Him by living an upright life.  The analogy of the ten-stringed harp appears - which if I recall, Augustine says is a reference to the decalogue.  That is to say, that one renders praise to God by living the law.
33. Wednesday Compline. Similar to the previous psalm, but the focus is much more on the Lord's generosity towards the just, the humble, the poor, etc.  Exhortation to praise the Lord for these things.
34. Tuesday Matins, divided in three.  Begins with a short imprecatory section: Expugna impugnantes me! ... Fiat via illorum tenebrae et lubricum - may their way be "slippery" and "in darkness."  A prayer in time of persecution / enemies, who speak peace with their mouths, but plot and war against the psalmist.
35. Thursday Lauds.  Three distinct sections: 
	1. The qualities of the unjust 
	2. The mercy and justice of the Lord.
	3. A prayer of security in the Lord who will protect.
	This psalm concludes with two verses, imagining what just ends will fall to the psalmist and his enemies who work iniquity: nec potuetunt stare.
36. Tuesday Matins, divided in three.  An extended exhortation to not only refrain from sin, but not to keep company with those who work iniquity.  Throughout the psalm the psalmist goes back and forth between the just and the wicked and compares their respective joys and sorrows.  Here is found the introit for confessors: "Os Justi meditabitur sapientiam, et lingua eius loquetur judicium."  We sang this at Vianneymas this past summer at a mass for vocations on the eastern shore of VA.
37. Tuesday Matins, divided in two.  One of the darkest psalms in the psalter.  This psalm is characterized by a plea for the Lord's mercy, a long laundry list lament of the psalmist's infirmity, sinfulness, rejection by even his own friends, and the misery at knowing his own condition, ending with a plea to the Lord: Intende in adjutorium meum, Dominus deus salutis meae.
38. Last psalm of Tuesday Matins (lots of dark psalms on this day :thinking:). General theme is the same as the last psalm, but shorter.  The exhortation is that life is fleeting, and there is a tearful cry to God for salvation.  A reference to each life as a pilgrimage (to Zion?): ego sum... peregrinus sicut omnes patres mei.
39. Tuesday Terce, divided in three.  Theme of Praise for the God who hears the psalmist's prayers, as well as a middle portion of the psalm where the psalmist meditates on what God truly desires: oblation of the heart, not a mere external oblation of holocausts.  I love the one line: ecce labia mea non prohibebo: Domine, tu scisti. "You know it, O Lord."  I've always found the ending three words humerous to throw out at my brothers or to repeat somewhat snidely to the Lord as a kind of brief prayer when passing through a chapel.  "Domine, tu scisti."  The Lord knows everything that's going on, and circumstances sure can be funny at times.
40. Tuesday Sext.  Blessed the man who understands that which concerns the destitute and poor...  He who suffers affliction is _blessed_ when he understands these things in light of God's providence!  Repeated prayers for God's mercy for the psalmists sins.  He knows of his own misery, and implores God for mercy, and the removal of his enemies.  Ends with a short and succint benediction: Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel a saeculo et usque in saeculum.  Fiat. Fiat.  The new breviary makes the last two words to be a response to the previous line dividing it between the sides.
41. Tuesday Sext, divided in two.  Famous psalm of total longing, even a physical longing for the Lord like thirst - Sicut cervus desiderat ad fontes aquarum.  The line: quare tristis es, anima mea? etc. will return in psalm 42, psalm at the foot.  same as the line "quare tristis incedo, dum affligit me inimicus." and the ending "quare tristis es.... et Deus meus."  

25-41 Reflection:

42. Tuesday Lauds. These two psalms are very very similar - between the explicitly repeated lines and the same themes of going up to the Lord's tabernacle, I wonder if perhaps psalm 42 is merely a poor copying of the previous psalm, or an abridged version.
43. Tuesday None, divided in three. A brief recalling of the Lord's works for His chosen people as passed down from generation to generation (patres nostri annuntiaverunt nobis - Pieper alludes to this in his essay on tradition).  Then there is a long lament, almost sounding accusatory at points:  You have sold your people at no price... a theatrical gag and a laughing stock among our neighbors.  The end of the psalm is a repeated cry to God for help.
44. Wednesday Matins, divided in two.  Just praying with this psalm in the new breviary, I always thought the whole psalm was about the daugher mentioned in verse 11, who is exhorted to forget her poeple and her father's house -> further reason for this is that a versicle from the old office in the common of the Blessed Virgin Mary uses the verse "specie tua, et pulchritudine tua" in what seems to be clear reference to Mary.  Only after closer inspection of Jerome's latin and our discussion in class did I realize that the first half of this psalm seems addressed to "the king," whom allegorically we can understand to be Our Lord.  The psalm forst speaks of the goodness and beauty and power of the king, and the second half is an exhortation to a daughter (zion?) to give herself in marriage to him ->  this is a royal wedding psalm!
45. Wednesday Matins.  A psalm of praise in the Lord's power, and the confusion and futile fighting of the world.  The earth is shaken, but Israel is at peace, for the Lord is her strength and refuge.
46. Monday Lauds.  A short royal psalm.  the kingdom of God and an exhortation for the nations to exult unto Him.
47. Wednesday Matins.  Transcendance of God - many references to the establishment of mount sion and the trembling of the nations at the establishment of God's city.
48. Wednesday Matins, divided in two.  The man who trusts in his own riches and strength is a fool, but he who trusts in the Lord will be blessed in this life and the next.
49. Wednesday Matins, divided in two.  The central image is God as supreme judge: he will preserve Israel on earth, not for sacrifice of bulls, but for their love and devotion.  The sinner is rebellious against providence.
50. Wednesday Matins, and every day at Lauds II.  The strongest and most commonly known paenitential psalm in the psalter.  All sin is ultimately against God and God alone.  There is a plea for cleansing in body and soul.  After this, the psalmist will be able to return to God in right worship and instruct sinners in gladness.
51. Wednesday Prime.  A strong rebuke against the sinful man who has taken delight in his iniquity, and a warning to him that God will enact justice.
52. Wednesday Prime. "The fool has said in his heart" - an echo of psalm 13 at the beginning of this psalm provides the overarching theme.  All have fallen into sin and abandoned God -> but He will redeem Israel.
53. Wednesday Terce.  A short petition for God's protection and judgement.
54. Wednesday Terce, divided in two.  A prayer of complaint in distress of enemies and an imprecatory petition against them.
55. Wedneday Sext. Continuing in the same theme as the preceeding psalms: the psalmist is in a time of persecution and has many enemies, but will hold fast to God, who continues to sustain and rescue him.
56. Wednesday Sext.  A plea for mercy - the enemies have prepared a snare, have dug a pit for me, but have fallen into it themselves.  concludes with a slightly longer section of praise of God than the preceeding psalms.
57. Wednesday Sext. The unjust speak of justice but don't follow through in action.  This psalm is a strong rebuke against the hypocritical.
58. Wednesday None, divided in two.  Same theme as 54-56.  Interesting, the fifth verse contains a protestation of the psalmist's innocence - something we haven't seen in a little while.
59. Wednesday None.  God raises up and God casts down - a psalm of God's almighty providence.  The nations will become wholly subject to God in the end - this is expressed in a series of images of God using the territories as lowly instruments - moab the washbowl, edom the footstool.
60. Wednesday Compline. A song of hope, envisioning the arrival of God's kingdom where the king shall reign and be in communion with God in His tabernacle.
61. Thursday Matins. This psalm takes the character of self-motivation -> the psalmist is exhorting first his own soul, then his people.
62. Sunday Lauds.  As one of the Sunday Lauds 1 psalms, this one is memorized and often on the brain as a way of entering into prayer.  It speaks of the desire of the psalmist within the sanctuary as intense, long lasting, and even phisical.  He stands before the Lord as one in a place that is deserta, invia, et inaquosa. verses 6-10 note the joys of union with God.  11-12, censored from the most recent roman breviary, speak of the coming judgement upon the just king and the enemies who seek the psalmist's soul.
63. Saturday Lauds. A prayer of petition consisting mainly of a image-laden list of the plots of the wicked against the just.
64. Wednesday Lauds. A prayer of hope based on the Lord's transcendance as mirrored in the power, beauty, and providence of nature.
65. A hymn of praise to God starting with an invitation to sing, and continuing with a litany to God's providence even in difficulty.
66. A very short psalm constituted by a kind of intercessory benediction for Israel so that all the nations might come to know the Lord.
67. The beginning of this psalm has become a common Catholic prayer of intercession against Satan.  Exurgat Deus et dissipentur inimici eius et fugiant qui oderunt eum a facie eius. - a verse often attached to images of the Veil of Veronica and other images of the Holy Face of Christ.  This psalm imagines the coming peaceful and transcendant kingdom of God.
68. A long psalm of petition in a dark time - The psalmist is in a dark place and surrounded by enemies, weeping and afflicted.  Even the good the psalmist does seems to be held against him by men(11-13)
69. A very short (6 verses!) psalm that seems to be drawn textually almost in entirety from earlier psalms.  I like the latin word here "erubescant" - It once was stuck in my head during a seven day silent retreat and that was pretty weird.
70. This psalm notes the providence of God to the psalmist even from his mother's womb, brief petition to be freed from the hands of sinners, a petition for divine assistance even unto old age, and a statement of intention to praise the Lord in the church and with music.
71. A petition for judgement, not upon the king, but seemingly asking God for a king who will rule with the right judgement of God.  The rest of the psalm imagines the rule of this king, which we can understand to refer prophetically to Christ and the Kingdom of Heaven.
72. This psalm begins positively: a song of thanks for God who has given goodness to the psalmist on account of his right relationship with the Lord and for the repayment of failure to the wicked.  The ending changes tone: I am brought to nothing and knew not, I am become as a beast before thee, etc.  The psalm ends with a statement of the psalmist's burning desire for God.
73. This psalm notes very strongly corporate persecution of God's people: they are cut down like grass.  Ends with a petition for divine help.
74. A triumphant hymn and a warning to sinners.  We will praise thee, God, for thy majesty and providence.  Do not act against Him, for he is judge over all.  Here is used the image of a cup of unmixed wine (which doesn't sound so bad to me, but I digress) of which the sinners must drink "the dregs." (which I guess does seem less enjoyable)
75. A song of God's transcendance who will break the powers of man characterized by the images of bow, shield, and sword.  God will be ultimately triumphant - pay Him homage!
76. A psalm that has two sections - the first is a kind of rhetorical questioning of God's providence in a time of suffering, the second is a recollection of God's providence towards Israel.  This recollection comforts and gives hope to the psalmist.
77. A brief poetic summary of Israel's history in relation to God's providential care.  An exhortation not to forget these things, but to pass them down from generation to generation lest they be forgotten.
78. This psalm is a protest to God concerning the evils suffered - including images of the heathens defiling the temple.  Then there is a deprecatory part, then a petetive part with an imagining of recompense.
79. Same as the last psalm, but less angry and more depressed.  How I feel when I sit down to do psalm logs.
80. Like psalm 77, containing an account of God's historical providence.  This one takes the form of a jubilous song.
81. A short psalm of petition for rescue and a warning to those who follow false gods.  The mention of god standing amidst a congregation of 'gods' is interesting.  It seems that they are not seriously countenancing the gods of the heathens as actually being deities, but to emphasize perhaps that even if these beings have power (on account of them being demons or something) God is wholly transcendant.
82. An imprecatory psalm recalling the historical actions of the heathens against Israel.
83. A wonderfully beautiful and balanced psalm of delight in union with God.  The delights found in the Lord's House.  This is another psalm fittingly chosen for Sunday Lauds 1.
84. A song of thanksgiving to a merciful and generous God.  Again, I think this with psalm 62 and 83 one of the most beautiful psalms in the psalter, and most present on my mind.
85. An extended petition for God's help - similar to the preceeding psalms, there may be a protestation of the attacks of the wicked, but it seems to be less dark in mood, and from a place of security in God, maybe because the psalmist is looking back upon these persecutions from a later time of security.
86. A hymn of Praise to God's mountain Sion.
87. One of the darkest (the darkest?) psalms in the psalter.  the psalmist feels alone and abandoned even by God himself.  Traditionally was prayed by Our Lord while imprisoned in the High Priest's house.
88. Explicit reference to the rule of David - how the Lord is providential, yet allows his beloved ones to suffer persecution.  There is a petition to the Lord to stay His hand, and to take mercy upon His servant.
89. A petition for God's help and an act of humility on account of the psalmist who notes the futility of man and the relative shortness of his life.
90. A song of confidence in God, noting that though all seems lost, God protects us with his hosts of angels and mighty power.
91. A hymn of praise to God who has given the psalmist victory and fruitfulness even to old age.
92. One of the "Dominus Regnavit" psalms.  A short and triumphant acclamation of the glory of God's reign.
93. This psalm notes the seeming triumph of sinners upon earth, but recalls the ultimate judgement that will be rendered by God.
94. The invitatory psalm prayed every day before matins.  A song exhorting to praise and to the softening of hearts toward the Lord, recalling the wandering of the israelites in the desert.
95. A song of praise to God exhorting the listener to ritual sacrifice and worship.
96. Another "Dominus Regnavit" psalm - this one referring to nature as a manifestation of God's glory and power, his transcendance over man, and an exhortation to praise.
97. A psalm of rejoicing, exhorting the listener to praise God upon instruments and with song.
98. Yet another "Dominus Regnavit" psalm this one noting that the nations are enraged against Him.  An exhortation to adore almighty God, recalling his historical providence and the figures of Moses and Aaron.
99. A very short song of invitation to sing joyfully to God and to enter his temple, for the Lord is sweet and his mercy endureth forever.
100. David recalls here his rule on earth -> that he acted justly and in accord with the law of God, loving Justice and hating iniquity.
101. A paenitential psalm - best characterized by its own introduction: a prayer of the poor man when he was anxious and poured out his supplication before the Lord.  It's a pretty dark psalm.
102. An exhortation to self: bless the Lord, my soul!  The rest of the psalm will tell us why we should bless Him: He is just and merciful, he is like a father to those who fear him, he will keep them safe in perpetuity.
103. A second exhortation beginning with the same words as the previous psalm.  This one tells us that we should bless the Lord because of his providence in the ordering of nature in all its majesty and terror.  Kirkegaardian in its imagery of terible beasts in a place of order: The sea dragon plays in the sea, the young lions seek their meat from God.
104. A song of exhortation to glory in God, recalling salvation history from Abraham until the posession of the land of Israel.  Great focus here upon the Exodus.
105.  This is the same as the previous psalm, but with more emphasis on the unworthiness of the fathers of God's merciful providence which serves to intensify it.
106. Another exhortation to give Glory to the Lord.  This one is less historical and more proverbial -> a kind of meta analysis of the cycle of providence, rebellion, petition for mercy, and restoration seen in the history of the Israelites.
107. A song of praise in the morning for God's providence -> the imagery of the nations as lowly tools returns.  Through God alone we shall succeed.
108. This is the funny psalm.  It was stricken in entirety from the psalter in the most recent edition of the Roman Brievary.  There are some creative curses against the deceitful man at whose hand the psalmist has suffered detraction.  A petition for Divine assistance.
109. Dixit Dominus - Used by Our Lord to teach that He is the Messiah spoken of in the new testament. Lots of good bits here: tu es sacerdos, ex utero ante luciferum genui te, etc.  The eternal priesthood.
110. A psalm of praise of God, noting that He takes the goods of the Gentiles and gives them to His own people.
111. Blessed the man who fears the Lord: this is a brief indication of the beauty and goodness of the upright life, and the Lord's providence to the one who lives rightly.
112.
