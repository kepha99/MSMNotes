### Morality as a member of the church
1. Church as a body - the actions of each member affects the others.
2. Prayer, Fasting, Almsgiving, not just for personal purification
	1. Praying for others in the church
	2. Almsgiving for the holy ones
	3. col 1:24
3. Head (Christ), and Soul (Holy Ghost) of the Church
	1. our actions now involve not only other members of the Church, but alos Christ and the Holy Ghost, such that when you act shamefully, not only are the other members of the body shamed, but somehow Christ and the HG are implicated. (1 Cor 6 "Do you not know your bodies are members of Christ? ... "temples of the Holy Spirit within you ... ?")
## Patristic Era Morality
---
NB: "We don't look at the fathers because they are priveledged in time, but rather because of their sanctity. They aren't some sort of alternative magesterium."
### Settings of Patristic Moral teaching
1. Scripture commentaries & Homilies are the main source
2. Works that deal thematically with moral issues / principles
	1. Four Works in particular by Augustine:
		1. On the Christian Life (followed by on the manicheaen way of life)
		2. De doctrina
		3. commentary on the sermon on the mount
		4. Enchiridion on Faith, Hope, Charity
3. Works that deal with particular ethical issues
	1. All sorts of issues: Veils, dancing, lying, usery, etc.
	2. often they differed on these issues -> e.g. on remarrying after infidelity
### Key themes / Characteristics
1. Scriptural
	1. in the sense that they didn't use scripture to support their moral teaching, rather their moral teaching flowed out of scripture.
	2. due to tropological sense, they saw all of scripture as having moral import
	3. pinkaers calls the fathers' reading of scripture "real" for two reasons:
		1. they think scripture actually describes reality
		2. they are supposed to effect change in how you live
2. Drew upon pagan culture
	1. (Neo)-Platonism
		1. easy connection: spiritual over material / soul over body
	2. Stoicism
		1. emphasis on submission to order through detachment and self-mastery
	3. Dangers: that pagan thought might contaminate the Gospel
		1. Devaluing of the material, bodily world
		2. Ascetisicm that can do damage to human goodness
3. Three models of the moral life: Martyrs, virgins, monastics
4. 
### Two further aspects of Monastic moral framing
1. the christian moral life is a struggle against evils
	1. overcoming fear through union with Christ
2. the need for spiritual fatherhood
	1. humility/obedience indispensable
