## Apostolic & Post-Apostolic

#### Overview & Historical Context
1. Time frame we're looking at is 33-100AD, and sources up to 150AD
	1. The liturgy of this period was largely based on the Jewish pattern of worship from the temple, synagogue, and homes
		1. Lit of word from synagogue
		2. lit of Eucharist from fourfold action and Chaburah or Todah
	2. Inclided both development(1) and some measures of diversity(2)
		1. Developments: Joining word and Eucharist (form), separation from Judaism and inclusion of the Greeks (influence),  Sundays (Time), Separation from the agape meal (form), new locations and arrangements (place).
		2. Diversity in: Traditions Lk/Pl and Mt/Mk, apostolic centers, liturgical languages, written sources
2. In the apostolic period, Christians still attended Temple and Synagogue
	1. Temple: The apostles did not initiate a separation from temple worship, but practiced it (Acts 2:46); seeing that Christ fulfilled the Covenant with Israel
	2. Synagogue: The apostles followed the jewish practice of reading the "scriptures" (i.e. the OT) and commenting on them; their commentary was the kerygma (preaching)
		1. This is the origin of what became the "apostolic preaching" and the lity of the word.
		2. Saint stephen was one such commentator.
3. Official judaism soon ostracized believers in Jesus as Messiah
	1. Christians had to develop their own forms of worship because of this, adapting Jewish (not pagan) forms of worship because they saw Judaism as true religion which Christ fulfilled
	2. Lit of word and Eucharist were joined somewhat early in this period
4. Context of Greco-Roman Society
	1. Jewish roots but then Gentiles (esp. God-Fearers, gentiles who were interested, but hesitant because of the moral requirements) quickly accepted Christ
	2. Initial problems: Gentile inclustion and Judaizers (those who wanted everyone to still keep the whole Jewish law as Christians)
	3. At first Christians were opposed only to Jewish authorities; then as the Church grew, they were opposed by Roman authorities
		1. Initially regarded by the Romans as a Jewish sect.
		2. As more gentiles became Christian, Hellenistic influences increased (true in Philosophy, theology, liturgy) e.g. Didache vs Justin Martyr
	4. The destruction of the temple furthered the distinction between Christians and Jews

#### Early Developments
1. Sabbath to Sunday
	1. Adopted and transformed the Jewish rhythm of prayer in time
		1. Weekly - Sunday
		2. Yearly - Feast of Easter, anniversity of martyrs
		3. Daily - 3 set hours (Acts 3:1) and the pater noster thrice (Didache)
	2. Sunday replaces the Sabbath as the day of worship
		1. The Sabbath represented the completion of the first creation(7th day), Israel's liberation from slavery(Exodus), and God's covenant with them(Sinai/Law)
		2. Replaced quickly with Sunday which recalls new creation(1st day), liberation from sin and death(resurrection), and Christ's new and eternal covenant, all of which was inaugurated by Christ's Resurrection, which occured on the first day of the week, Sunday (Acts 20:7, Rev 1:10) (Ratzinger: convincing historical evidence of the resurrection, and a remarkable departure from Judaism)
	3. Time of day for Eucharist
		1. originally evenings as indicated in Acts, like the Seder and Chaburah
		2. them mornings, which better commemorated the resurrection (Acts 20:7?)
		3. Christ is the "rising sun" - Eastward position of prayer was a Mediterranean Jewish custom
			1. Adopted by Christians who look east for the rising sun, Christ, who will return (eschatological expectation). (now we just look at each other
2. Breaking of Bread
	1. Most ancient term for Eucharist: the breaking of bread (not a term used in typical greek or jewish culture to indicate an ordinary meal, foreign to both cultures' literature)
	2. Originates in the NT - links Eucharist to action at last supper
		1. Lk 24:30-35 Supper at Emmaus
		2. Acts 2:42, 46 Luke's description of early Church
		3. 1 Cor 10:16 Pauline Eucharistic Description
	3. Paul's account: 1 Cor  11:17-34 Most extensive teaching on breaking of bread in NT ca 53-54 AD
		1. Biblical and histrical witness to the apostolic eucharist carried out at Jesus' command.
		2. Sain Paul addesses this because of issues in the church:
			1. Selfish drunkenness
			2. Divisions and factions; exclusion, esp. of poor
			3. Lack of awareness of Christ's body and blood
	4. Agape Meal - the meal that was eaten between the two consecrations of bread and wine
		1. Paul's account testifies that a meal took place between the consecrations of bread and wine.
		2. Early Separation
			1. At some period, (likely 1st c.) the agape meal was distinguished and removed from the Eucharistic celebration
			2. When Mt. and Mk. wrote, it must have already been customary in their locality to put the two consecrations together sine meal (Jungmann 10)
		3. Natural reasons for separation:
			1. As the assemblies grew, they needed more space
			2. Central to the event is the spiritual reality of the two consecrations
			3. Transition to morning celebration - no need for early morning meal
			4. the celebration became principally a liturgical commemoration
		4. Historical remnants of agape meal
			1. Catacombs - depict agape meals at the tombs of martyrs
			2. Hippolytus - in the Easter liturgy, the initiated received milk, honey, and water amid their reception of the Body and Blood of Christ
			3. Eastern liturgy - still uses the Antidoron, non-consecrated blessed bread at the end of mass
3. Shift in location of Eucharist
	1. Homes:
		1.  upper room (Acts 1:15)
		2.  private houses (acts 2)
		3. house of mary, mother of mark (acts 12)
		4. lydia in philippi
		5. prisca and aquila in ephesus
	2. Norm until ca. late 200s
		1. Due to being expelled from synagogue and destruction of temple
		2. Illegal religion in Rome, so no public assemblies
		3. Typical dimensions of homes at the time would have only allowed for about 20-30 people
	3. Larger rooms - Dining rooms
		1. Reclined on couces
			1. Triclinium - the three stepped couch with a mensa in the middle
		2. Eventually with more people and separated meal there becan to be one table with a chair for Bishop, who faced east
			1. Eastern liturgy retained free standing altar, bishop's throne behind it, and eastward celebration.

#### Initial Liturgical Diversity
1. Apostolic Centers - each one became a source of distinct liturgical tradition
	1. Jerusalem James
	2. Antioch - Peter
	3. Alexandria - Mark
	4. Rome - Peter
	5. Ephasus - John
2.  Liturgical Languages:
	1. Hebrew: the liturgical language of the Temple and Synagogue, and naturally entered Christian worship
	2. Aramaic: spoken language of Palestine; preserved in some Syrian rites and Maronite rite (syriac)
	3. Greek: Most common language of the Empire; NT written in greek, it was the earliest Christian liturgical language
	4. Latin: became the official language of the Roman empire and religion
		1. Only a munority of the Roman Empire's population was Roman in origin, so latin was widely used outside Italy ca. 4th c.
		2. Latin first noted used in lity 2nd. c north africa, Rome adopted this later.

#### Primary Sources: Didache
1. First non-Scriptural document on the Liturgy
	1. ca. 50 AD - 100 AD -> earliest non-canonical orthodox liturature
	2. Witness to apostolic tradition
2. Genre: church orders -> distribution of norms
3. Emphasis on Sunday as new day of worship (14.1)
4. Highlights confession of sins prior to eucharist (14.1)
